        <h4>Master of Molecular Science and Software Engineering</h4>
        <p class = "edu-desc">In my Masterâ€™s degree in Molecular Science and Software Engineering at UC Berkeley, I learned 
          to combine molecular science with modern software engineering, machine learning, and high-performance computing.
          The program emphasized both technical and professional skills, from algorithm design and data analysis to leadership, 
          ethics, and project management. For my capstone project, I partnered with Merck to fine-tune a large language model (LLM),
          applying these skills to a real-world scientific challenge.</p>

        <h4>B.S. Biochemistry (Honors), Minor in Applied Math</h4>
        <p>Graduated with Research Honors</p>
        <p class="edu-desc"> At the University of Washington, I earned a B.S. in Biochemistry with a minor in Applied Math, 
          graduating with Research Honors. I conducted pharmacology research in the Chavkin Lab and completed a NIDA internship
           at Harvard Medical School, gaining hands-on experience in neuroscience and drug-related studies. I also taught for 
           the Chemistry and Computer Science departments, helping students learn complex concepts. Outside the classroom, 
           I served as Fundraising Officer for the Neurobiology Club, supporting student initiatives and events.</p>
