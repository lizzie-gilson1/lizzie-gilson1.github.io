      <h3>Peptide Digest</h3>
      <p>
        For my capstone project of my Masters Degree, I partnered with Merck to reimagine the process of finding and reading scientific articles. 
        I, along with a team of two other students, fine-tuned an LLM and created a front-end web-app that summarized articles, scraped their metadata, and
        provided a relevance score for users. I worked with the Gemma Model and applied Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) to the model using the Performance Enhancement 
        for Training (PEFT) library. The fine-tuning process was then initiated with predefined training arguments, incorporating qLora and the Supervised Fine-Tuning Trainer (SFTTrainer).

      <h3>Sentiment Analysis Prediction</h3>
      <p>
        This project aims to understand how people's feelings in Amazon reviews have changed over time and create computer programs that can predict those feelings. 
        We looked at a large set of Amazon reviews from 1996 to 2014 and used a VADER sentiment analysis to understand if the reviews were positive or negative. 
        Then we built different models, using linear regression techniques, to estimate how people would feel based on things like the year the review was written, 
        the length of the review, and whether the reviewer was verified. Results suggest success in tracking sentiment trends and emphasize the importance of sentiment analysis 
        in understanding consumer feedback nuances. Look at the github repository: <a href="https://github.com/lizzie-gilson1/AmazonReviews_Sentiments">here</a>

      <h3>Parallelization of a Particle Simulation</h3>
      <p>
        This project takes a naive implementation of a particle simulation and parallelizes it using MPI. We were successful in significantly improving the code performance. Additionally this project was
        done through Perlmutter, a supercomputer at the National Energy Research Supercomputing Center in Berkeley. You can see our results and explanation
        of our implementation in this <a href="files/Parallel_Report.pdf" download="Parallel_Report.pdf">project report</a>.
